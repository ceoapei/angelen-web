    <h1>Untuk Angelen ðŸ’–</h1>
    <div class="longtext">
      I wonderâ€¦ have I ever hurt you without realizing it? Have I ever let you down without meaning to? Apei nggak tahu pasti, tapi kalau itu pernah terjadi kalau ada kata-kataku yang tanpa sengaja menusuk, kalau ada janjiku yang tak sempat terpenuhi, kalau ada momen di mana kamu butuh seseorang dan aku tidak ada di sana I am truly sorry.

      Itâ€™s never because I didnâ€™t care. I care, more than words could ever say. But life has its way of pulling people apart, of making distances grow even when we donâ€™t want them to. And sometimes, I get caught up in my own world, not realizing that maybeâ€”just maybeâ€”you needed me at that moment.

      If I ever made you feel alone, please know that was never my intention. I wish I could always be there whenever the weight of the world feels too much for you. I wish I could always be the shoulder you lean on when life gets too heavy. But I also know that I canâ€™t promise to always be there in every single moment, no matter how much I want to.

      But even if I canâ€™t always be right by your side, please donâ€™t ever doubt this: I will always care. I will always wish the best for you. And no matter what happens, no matter how much time passes, you will always be someone important to me.

      I have shared my thoughts with many, watched their eyes glaze over, their nods polite but empty. And in those moments, I wondered was I speaking too softly, or was the world simply too loud? But then, there was you. With you, I never have to raise my voice to be heard. I never have to rearrange my words, you catch the meaning before I even say it. And in your silence, I hear everything I needâ€”understanding, patience and love.

      So let the world be noisy. Let the crowds listen but never truly hear. Because in this chaos, in this vast sea of voices, I have found the one who understands me without me having to beg to be understood.

      Lastly, I want you to know that I really appreciate you, so much. You are one of the few people who truly gets me. Thank you for always being there for me. My life much better when you are around. Time behaves differently when I am with you. Hours collapse into seconds when we are together. Yet seconds stretch into eternities when we are apart.
